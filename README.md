# Web Portfolio | Emilia Jardim

## Concept

The best way to present your work, and what you able to do, is putting it to practice in real scenery. Instead of setting up different topics and themes of my work during the Interactive Media Design Program, I decided to create an experimental enterprise called Tourist Ottawa. Thus, most parts of my IMD level 2 assignments were focused on this subject. In this way, I created a collection of webpages, blog posts, mockups, designs, photographs, and videos that are integrated and part of a big final project, a web portfolio.

## Tourist Ottawa Website

This web portfolio is the final assignment of the course Responsive Web Design II. Developed based on a User Experience project. Thus,  the elements (icons, components, bars, buttons) were chosen considering the best web design practices. The main requirements of it were:

- Design optimized for a variety of browsers, devices, and screens sizes.
- Accessibility standards, including semantic markup, readable texts, and being functional using only the keyboard.
- Modern layout techniques, Flexbox or CSS Grid, CSS Frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation.
- Usage of libraries royalty-free to web fonts, images, illustrations, videos, or any other asset.
- Images and illustrations optimized.

## Structure and Development

The pages were built using a mix of Responsive Web Design techniques. The structure was entirely constructed in HTML, however, the style is a mixture of my choice of CSS components, Bootstrap, and some punctual design directly in the HTML. 
There is just one JavaScript action, it is derivated from Bootstrap. 

## Challenges

1. Using Bootstrap: the framework is easy to manage, however, it is not naturally responsive. Because of it, I had to set up manually margins, paddings, and many other configurations to make the elements well-positioned and great appealing.
2. Many pages: this portfolio has six pages. It was necessary a long time to create each one, selecting appropriate images, and adjusting the details.
3. Media Queries: facing many issues with Bootstrap, I had to create four media queries, default up to 375px, 768px, 990px, and 1580px. It was a consequence of having two different navigation bars (main navigation and social media icons), and also to set up the visual of the cards.

## Learnings

I realized, after this module of the IMD Program, I have learned, deeply, many techniques and tools, acquiring important skills. Also, I became able to execute complex design projects professionally. As a result, now I am a professional more prepared and multidisciplinary, apt to work for design, digital content, and marketing companies/departments.

Many of the courses I did during these two terms of the Program, I have already had some previous contact working or studying in my past background. However, it is the first time I have learned Responsive Web Design. In these last few months, I gained specific knowledge about this topic and great hands-on ability on it. It is a good opportunity to thank you, my teachers, for that. 

## Resources
When facing issues on my development, I found great resources and forums that helped me to find the solutions.
Also, I used Code Pen examples and exercises from previous classes. They were, exceptionally, useful to remember different attributes, and components we have learned during the term, as well as how I could use them.
