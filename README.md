# Portfolio | Concept

In my point of view, the best way to present your work is putting it to practice, in a real scenary. Thus, I decided to create an experimental enterprise called Tourist Ottawa. Most part of my IMD level 2 working was focused on this topic. In this way, my portfolio has a collection of webpages, blog, mockups, designs, photographs, and video with this subject.

## Structure and Development

The pages were built using a mix of Responvive Web Design techniques. The structure was entirely constructed in HTML, however, the style is a misture of CSS components, Bootstrap, and some punctual desing directly the HTML. 
There are just one JavaScript action and it is derivated from Bootstrap. 

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Challenges
1. Bootstrap: the framework is easy to use, however, it is not naturally responsive. Because of it, I had to set up manually margins, paddings, and many others configurations to make the elements well-positionated and great appealing.
2. Many pages: this portfolio has six pages. It was necessary a long time to create each one, selecting appropriate images, and adjusting the details.
3. Media Queries: facing many issues with Bootstrap, I had to create 04 media queries, default up to 375px, 768px, 990px, and 1580px. It was consequency of having two different navigation bars (main navigation and social media icons), and also to set up the visual of the cards.

## Resources
When facing issues on my development, I found good resources and forums that helped me to find the solution.

- [HARSHIT TEWARY YOUTUBE CANAL](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcPvWFLBFTZNqIlvUhI32Fw/)
- [STACK OVERFLOW](https://stackoverflow.com/)

Also, I used the Code Pen examples and exercises from previous classes. They were exceptionally useful to remember different attributes, and components we have learned during the term, as well as how I could use them.
